ChestXray dataset

ChestX-ray dataset comprises 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients with the text-mined fourteen disease image labels (where each image can have multi-labels), mined from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing. Fourteen common thoracic pathologies include Atelectasis, Consolidation, Infiltration, Pneumothorax, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Effusion, Pneumonia, Pleural_thickening, Cardiomegaly, Nodule, Mass and Hernia, which is an extension of the 8 common disease patterns listed in our CVPR 2017 paper.

Contents
1. 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray PNG images in 1024*1024 resolution (under images folder)
2. Meta data for all images (Data_Entry_2016.csv): Image Index, Finding Labels, Follow-up #, Patient ID, Patient Age, Patient Gender, and View Position.
3. Bounding boxes for ~1000 images (BBox_List_2016.csv): Image Index, Finding Label, Bbox[x, y, w, h]. [x y] are coordinates of each box's topleft corner. [w h] represent the width and height of each box.
